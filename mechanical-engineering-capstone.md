This intensive seminar, led by Neil Rothman, is a graduation requirement that is geared toward teaching students to engage in the kind of collaborative problem-solving they will encounter on the job. The seminar covers topics such as the “design of components that form a complete working system; engineering economics, performance-cost studies, optimization, engineering design practice through case studies; and legal and ethical responsibility of the designer” ("Mechanical Engineering"). What we found most compelling about the course, however, is the fact that student groups are hired by a real client to create a specific material product. They are given a limited amount of funding to complete their projects, and they must deliver a fully-designed prototype by the end of the semester. We were given permission to observe students early in the design process, at classroom presentations with clients in attendance, as well as the end of semester showcase when they demonstrated their final designs. In addition to documenting the mid-term presentations student teams made to their clients, we also took photos of a semester-end poster session and interviewed Rothman at length.
