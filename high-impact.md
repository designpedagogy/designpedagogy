The educational design methods we observed in studio environments uniformly aimed to heighten the impact of student experience. The sites we visited were all designed to include an element of risk; design studio pedagogy is necessarily risky and disorienting. As Randall Bass suggests of high impact teaching practices in general, productive disorientation entails perching students at “the porous boundaries between the classroom and life experience,” where they benefit from the combined force of “social learning, authentic audiences, and integrative contexts” (n.p.). Variations of each of these forces were present in every studio we observed. What Bass calls “authentic audiences,” we tend to think of in terms of varying degrees of publicness. Studio students worked publicly in several ways. For example, they attempted to impact issues of importance to local publics of diverse sizes and compositions, which required defending their work in critiques (“crits”)—pictured below—that were often open to the public and attended by practicing professionals. Students also engaged directly with and performed research in communities and created work for eventual public circulation.

Additionally, students encounter high impact learning practices in studio work by constantly juggling knowledge at different levels of scale, from the conceptual to the detailed nitty-gritty. This toggling generates impact because, as Casey Boyle puts it in his exploration of glitch, “when we are positioned to pay attention to in-betweens, especially the mediation work of interfaces and infrastructures, we often come to better understand how those in-betweens help configure our personal, academic, professional, and civic practices” (13). Design studio pedagogy, especially through high impact learning experiences, positions students in “in-between” situations. Mechanical engineering professor Neil Rothman describes a number of these in-between situations in the following interview clips:

Once students find themselves navigating multiple publics—including but far from limited to traditional classroom environments—and actively toggling between the conceptual and the applied, most studio heads hold students’ work to high, even professional standards of production. Rothman does so with his mechanical engineering students, relying on his experience as a former American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) judge. He describes his rationale in this interview clip:

Similarly, Patricia Andrasik holds her students to professional standards in the LEEDlab by adhering to the LEED certification standards, and by bringing in officials from LEED for crits. Based on our observations, we have come to believe that it is the combination of both public engagement and (context-specific) professional standards that leads to high impact learning. 

It is important to acknowledge that some scholars in rhetoric and composition have raised concerns about embracing the various risky teaching practices we have described in relation to high impact learning experiences. For example, Phillips and Leahy suggest that creating unpredictable spaces might also make them less accessible, safe, and equitable, wisely stating, “Before we can construct spaces, we need to consider who will inhabit those spaces” (124). Relatedly, they also ask, “How do we avoid making unfair or potentially exploitative demands of our students when we make their experiences, investments, interests, and struggles the central focus of the class?” (123)

Students we spoke with raised similar concerns about risk and reward, voicing antipathy for the choices of some jurors. Martin, for example, commented on the need to grow “thick skin” in his role as a LEEDlab student.

It is not hard to imagine what effects the experiences Martin relates might have on all students, let alone students who are more tenuously holding on to positions in higher education in the first place. 

Interestingly, Martin’s teammate, Joanna, offers what sounds like a different stance.

What interests us in Joanna’s response to Martin is her commitment to finding productive solutions to design problems. Implicit in her faith in the system of design studio pedagogy seems to be the idea that the expertise of jurors can always be valuable, even if students, preferably with the aid of faculty members, filter feelings of failure, or frame failure as an important step in a new direction.

These students raise serious concerns, which must be addressed in the crafting of learning spaces, even—especially—ones that embrace risk. For some students educational spaces are already riskier than they are for their peers, and any teaching practice, no matter how well-intentioned, has radically failed if it reinforces disenfranchisement or marginalization. That said, based on our experiences, studio learning environments coordinate the kinds of work and relationships that help foster inclusivity rather than prevent it—in two ways, specifically. 

First, we found that students wanted to take on projects that made a difference to real users and audiences, sometimes because of their professor’s choices but sometimes, we think, because they worked with a sense of the public in mind. In the UMBC engineering studio, for instance, students worked to adapt a lacrosse helmet for an athlete with a specific medical need, as described here by Rothman.

In general, there seems to be a belief that engaged, high impact work—with real users and audiences in mind—“ups the stakes,” as [author’s name] and Rothman agree in this interview clip.

This is also apparent at Georgetown’s Studio Collaborative, where student teams work in the space between rhetoric, bioethics, and science policy. One team created a new hospital intake form, designed with transgender patients in mind, in order to address concerns about identity-appropriate language while also compiling proper medical history records. Catholic University’s LEEDlab similarly “ups the stakes” for students by asking them to engage in ongoing projects aimed at environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure. Our point with these examples is not that a student might not still experience marginalization in the context of this kind of work, but that, through engagement with difference and diversity, students, faculty, and other participants seem to become attuned to the real situations of real people, and thereby become attuned to each other’s particular needs and struggles as well. In other words, the habits of mind they develop when working with publics transfer to classroom interactions.

Second, judging from what we observed, the risk that comes with high impact teaching encourages supportive and inclusive relationships. For example, faculty meet often with student teams in both formal and informal settings to check in, brainstorm, and offer ideas. Student teams meet in classrooms but also in alternate spaces at times of their choosing (e.g. late night meetings in makerspaces, dorm rooms, coffee shops, etc.). To counteract the feelings of uncertainty and risk associated with high impact practices, this type of community building work is essential. 

We also discovered that it is not only the students who take on risk in design pedagogy, as described by [author’s name] in this audio “field note.”

High impact learning experiences invite more risk for students and faculty, but they also seem to bring with them a sense that the risk is worth the reward. Like all teaching, the tactics of design studio pedagogy require thoughtful efforts on the part of faculty. Perhaps sharing risk among faculty and students offers a kind of ballast, or a modest form of insurance, in high impact teaching and learning experiences. If we are able to contain the risk to an acceptable degree while acknowledging that even the most careful planning can be upended by complex events, we can hit the sweet spot, mentioned above by Bass, in which the learning experiences we design include the combined force of “social learning, authentic audiences, and integrative contexts” (“Disrupting”).
