Like, they pull people towards them. They’re not motivated by pushing, therefore, you don’t have to put much effort into it. The best thing to do is to drop them into a crit, and then tell them there’s going to be another one. And very little has to be done after that because they have that force that’s pulling them.”"

You know, you’re talking about trying to move students through as much of this [the Squiggle?] as you can, but at least for now we’re still talking about working within the constraints of one semester.” Arjun Dhillon: “Yeah.” [Author]: “And how do you bring into those 14 weeks some version of the kind of work that professionals can do in huge teams over months and months and months?” Arjun Dhillon: “Um, you don’t try to move them through it. They have to move through it themselves. Like, you don’t give a vehicle; you give scaffolding. That’s an important point. A scaffolding that demands or motivates them to drive themselves through it. Because, like, I don’t know what happens each day. I’m always, every semester, surprised by every team, deeply surprised by what they’ve come up with – both bad and good. But it’s also all good, immensely creative and unexpected by them and us. This is a comment I hear every semester and from every student, so there’s evidence of a common theme, of students being surprised by their own ability. And every semester students just start to get it at some point. Different students differently; usually it happens quickly within a team. And usually everyone on a team gets it enough to operate with a common language. And a lot of people get it on an even deeper level; I can’t really explain it. And the scaffolding just has to be motivating work; there is no route and there is no path - other than what they create for themselves. If you move someone through it or try to direct them, orchestrate it, or propel them in any way, they’re not going to be doing studio work. And it’ll be a problem. You have to let them do it - to struggle and fail. The critique is part of the scaffolding that works as a pulling force. In practical terms it's a deadline, an expected delivery in an intense public format. It’s hugely motivating for students.”"

It’s just done systematically, just like a lot of other fields. And what’s interesting to note about it at the level of definition is that, and maybe this is true of other areas, it’s super versatile. It doesn’t matter what the outcome is. I think what matters is that it’s intrinsically in service to others. It always has been. And it continues to be, even now as it expands far beyond artifacts.”"

Whether than means producing a full, very detailed blueprint, or in a lot of areas, like in digital design, starting to work at some point working with engineers and developers and giving them some artifacts, but also working them, talking with them in tandem. To translate it themselves. Going from a state where the thing doesn’t exist, not in the minds of anybody, and not in real life either.

You can engage in a creative process, to maybe express or create something. Where like you don’t have a goal, you can’t know what the outcome is up front. So you don’t have a picture that you keep comparing your progress to. How do you track progress? One of the ways that artists do it is to work at two levels constantly: to work up close with a painting and then step back. You have to have both perspectives, and the only way to do it is to go back and forth.”

That is, the work will be nonlinear, just as the Squiggle is, and therefore intentionally inefficient. Students, Dhillon says, need to expect to be creative, to generate multiple competing big ideas, to test them, to fail, and to re-start. More than once, even. Dhillon also noted that the Squiggle represents two major stages he’s observed in design work: the big Squiggle, on the left side of the image, which is when students move back and forth between the large context of an issue or a site and solutions from different paradigms and even fail with multiple prototypes. And then there’s the little Squiggle on the right side of image, the tighter but still loopy pattern, which is what happens once a design team settles on the general parameters of their work while still iterating with the specifics. From what I’ve seen there is a drawback to using the Squiggle in this way. It seems to kind of ‘black box’ things. But here’s what’s good about that. The Squiggle doesn’t pretend that there are preordained patterns or rhythms to design work. Yes, sure, there are some broad common steps: ideation, prototyping, testing, and so on. But the Squiggle with its intentional, ambiguous simplicity, insists that every student project needs to respond to the world more than the parameters of a classroom model. And that sounds to me like exactly the kind of situation that I seek for my rhetoric students."

When I’ve taught in the studio collaborative I’ve received the worst student evaluations of my career [laughs]. Was that dramatic enough for you? Uh, but still. This is a serious and interesting issue. I’d like to qualify a little bit. The studio collaborative is a pilot project and like any pilot there are bumps along the way, which certainly affect student evaluations. Also the evals were better the second time that I taught in this class consortium than in the first. Again, but still, this raises serious questions. As we heard from Martin and Joanna, from the LEED lab, as you may remember, uh, these students seemed pretty well acclimated to studio methods. Martin notes at one point in the interview that jurors’ feedback can seem too harsh. But both Martin and Joanna agree that such methods are good, necessary, even virtuous. It’s all about the work, they seem to agree. So what do humanities students have to say about design pedagogy practices, at least in their form at Georgetown? Paraphrasing, to protect anonymity, I’ll share with you four major student critiques of the studio collaborative from real student evaluations. Number 1: There’s tons of work and it’s unevenly distributed. Super intense periods occur before the crits and there are real lulls in between the crits, students say. So much work that many students said they deserved four credits rather than three. Number 2: Students react unhappily to the need that crits create to juggle different and even competing feedback from jurors and faculty members. Many of our students want linear feedback. Do X, Y, Z, and you’ll get such and such a grade. Crits will never be that straightforward. Number 3: my undergraduate students don’t like that our model places them in teams with graduate students, and in some instances they struggle to create equitable team roles. Number 4: Lastly, some students note that the studio work overwhelms or obscures the rhetoric work. And the students have a real complaint here, uh, that one part of their labor takes away from another. But I actually think that it’s something different. The students are still not yet seeing how the readings and discussions in class should and can inform or even shape their studio work. This feels like a failing on my part. These four complaints are real and legitimate, but we also need to put them up against the fact that the student projects have been, almost without exception, rhetorically sophisticated, and impactful. And that students have been able to talk and write about how their projects work rhetorically using the conceptual apparatus from readings and discussions throughout the semester. So there’s a lot of conclusions we can draw from this feedback, but I’ll stop here. Everyone in the humanities who considers design pedagogy practices will need to think about these issues, how to ameliorate them, but also whether or not they’re in a secure enough employment position to withstand a potential hit on their student evaluations. The takeaway might be that there is real risk here for both students and faculty.”

And I noticed, I’m assuming he’s a student, pull out a notebook and start actually drawing the prototype that was being talked about in a presentation. This really intricate looking drawing. It just struck me how this DIY, sort of collaborative ethic that we saw definitely in the student presentations leaked out into the audience and clearly it was not just an ethic of the class but this is how this program, this institution…these are sort of the values that they stress, obviously. And this person was learning in a really material way. He was physically copying a prototype to understand it better.”

They don’t speak engineering. So, the students, even more so in terms of a kind of design thinking perspective it’s like yes, right, you really have to understand the user and they do not speak your language. And you have to figure out what that means and try to translate that into some kind of engineering requirement that you can work towards. And we tell them you are not done until you can demonstrate that your system meets the requirements, but if you didn’t do a good job translating their [user] needs into your requirements, you built the wrong thing. So, you may have built exactly what you specified but it still could be the wrong thing. And that’s actually where a lot of the art and experiences comes in and learning how to do that. If I gave them specs they could always build something that met the specs but being to be able to develop the specifications, which is the first thing we do in this class, is meeting with the customers and trying to convert what they want into a specification.”
